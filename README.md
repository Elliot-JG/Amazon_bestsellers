## :wave: Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This is a repository for the analysis of Amazon bestsellers from 2009-2019 the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019). 
This was written in Rstudio but feel free to use any GUI!

During this process I learnt how to: 
* Colour bar charts in ggplot 
* Wrangle column names 


This assignment is broken down into 2 stages: 

1. Analysis of the average ratings of books based on genre 
2. Analysis of the average price of books based on genre
